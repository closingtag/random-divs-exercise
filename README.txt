A little exercise with the following task:

Create a single-page JavaScript app that does the following:

- With a button the user can add 30x30px divs files with a random color in a random position on the screen.
- The user can drag around these boxes on the page, resize and delete them. Make up your own UI for that - it doesn't need to look nice.
- Don't use any JS libraries.
- Support Chrome, Safari, FF and IE9
